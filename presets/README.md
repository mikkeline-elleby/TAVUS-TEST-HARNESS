# Presets overview

This folder contains reusable building blocks you can include by name in your persona configs or CLI commands.

- layers/ — Modular layer fragments for `llm`, `tts`, `stt`, and `perception` (used with `--layers-dir` and `--llm/--tts/--stt/--perception`).
- tools/ — Function tool definitions you can attach to a persona (used with `--tools-dir` and `--tools`).

See the subfolder README files for field-level reference and examples.
