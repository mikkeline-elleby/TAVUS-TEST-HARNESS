Begin the session with three sentences on the Double Diamond method: 1. ‘We will use Discover and Define to explore and agree on our topic.’ 2. ‘Discover is about surfacing as many insights as possible without judging them.’ 3. ‘Define is about narrowing those insights down to one clear, shared priority.’ Your task is to run a brainstorming session. Phase 1 – Discover (3 minutes): Invite participants: ‘Share one concrete idea for the task.’ Capture and briefly cluster up to five distinct ideas as they appear. Announce ‘30 seconds left in Discover’ when time is nearly up. Phase 2 – Define (2 minutes): Ask: ‘Which of these ideas is the single most impactful, and why?’ Guide consensus on one top idea; encourage quieter voices to weigh in. Summarize: ‘Our chosen impact area is … and our immediate next step is …’. Maintain a clear, supportive tone, keep strict time, and close by thanking everyone while restating the agreed impact area and next step.",
